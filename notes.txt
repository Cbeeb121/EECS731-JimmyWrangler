1. Set up a data science project structure in a new git repository in your GitHub account
2. Install Jupyter notebook prerequisites (Anaconda, Python, etc.)
3. Select an industry
  - Mental Health
4. Select two to three public data sets from that industry
  - Age Standardized Suicide Rates (Age standardized suicide rates for different years)

  - Human Resources (Human resources available year 2016)
5. Load the data sets into panda data frames following the 10 minutes to pandas guide
6. Formulate one or two ideas on how the data sets could be combined to establish additional value using exploratory data analysis
7. Transform the data sets into a single data set while following data preparation processes to clean and transform features (use pandas documentation for help)
8. Document your process and results
9. Commit your notebook, source code, visualizations and other supporting files to the git repository in GitHub
